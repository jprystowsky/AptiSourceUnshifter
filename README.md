AptiSourceUnshifter
===================

An application for restoring data that you have accidentally "encrypted" (obfuscated) in the style of character-shifted strings in Aptify decompiled assemblies

Sometimes, inventing your own encryption methodology seems "good enough," and in these instances you might be tempted to use a simple shift cipher (Caesar cipher) to make otherwise readable ASCII strings unreadable to the layperson.

In the event that you have done this in exactly the same way that Aptify does in their compiled assemblies, and you need a quick and easy way legally to reverse your own application of this obfuscation methodology, this application can help.

In no way is this software intended to be used to make decompiled Aptify assemblies easier to read.
